# Sorting Sequences

## Sorting Numerically vs. Alphabetically

   - At a computer's most basic level everything, including words, are interpreted in ones and zeros. Sorting works much the same using the numerical value of an `int` and `float` or the ordinal value of a `str` character.

   - By default Python sorting methods sort from smallest to largest. This can be modified by adjusting the `reverse` parameter.

   - Furthermore, a `key` can be assigned to tell Python what function to use to decide a unique sorting order. By default this parameter is `None` and sorts by numerical values of the items found in the sequence to be sorted.

More information can be found on Python sorting at the following links:

   - [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_sorted.asp#gsc.tab=0)
   - [PythonDocs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#sorted)

### Two ways to perform sorting:

   - `sorted(item, key, reverse)` - This function works for `str`, `tuple`, `list`, and `dict` data types. It produces a COPY of the specified item sorted according to the key and reverse values given.

   - `.sort(key, reverse)` - This method ONLY works on `list` objects. It reaches into the memory location of where the `list` is stored and PERMANENTLY sorts the `list`

## Sorting a list

### Numerically sort a list of numbers
Scenario: 	
What to sort 	How to sort it
num_lst 	smallest to largest
```
num_lst = [5,4,3,9,20,5,40,89,46]

num_lst_sorted = sorted(num_lst)
print(num_lst_sorted)
#output:   [3, 4, 5, 5, 9, 20, 40, 46, 89]
```
- Using the reverse parameter

Scenario: 	
What to sort 	How to sort it
num_lst 	largest to smallest
```
num_lst = [5,4,3,9,20,5,40,89,46]

num_lst_lg_sm = sorted(num_lst,reverse=True)
print(num_lst_lg_sm)
#output:  [89, 46, 40, 20, 9, 5, 5, 4, 3]
```
### Revisiting ord() and chr()

Remember that the ordinal value of any str can be found by using the ord() function and the character value of any int can be found using the chr() function.
```
x = 'a'
x_ord = ord(x)
print(x_ord)
#output:  97

letter_num = 97
letter = chr(97)
print(letter)
#output:  a
```

Alphabetically' sorting a list of characters

    The word 'Alphabetically' is purposely surrounded in quotations because of the discussion we just had about the `ord()` function. Each character corresponds to an `int` and it is by these `int` that the sorting is actually performed.
```
characters = ['z', 'd', 'B', 'A', 'a', 'Z']

sorted_chars = sorted(characters)
print(sorted_chars)
#output:  ['A', 'B', 'Z', 'a', 'd', 'z']
```
Let's get this sorted in actual alphabetical order.
We can provide a value to key to accomplish this
```
characters = ['z', 'd', 'B', 'A', 'a', 'Z']

sorted_chars = sorted(characters,key=str.lower)
print(sorted_chars)
#output:  ['A', 'a', 'B', 'd', 'z', 'Z']
```
- The `key` in the above example evaluates all of the characters as if they were lowercase. Alternatively, you could use `str.upper` and would still get the same result.

Another example of sorting words into reverse alphabetical order:
```
words = ['This', 'is', 'a', 'list', 'with', 'words']

sorted_words = sorted(words,key=str.upper,reverse=True)
print(sorted_words)
#output:  ['words', 'with', 'This', 'list', 'is', 'a']
```
### Sorting items based on length

Another way to sort items could be from shortest to longest and vice versa.

Sort the `list` of `words` seen above from the shortest to the longest word
```
words = ['This', 'is', 'a', 'list', 'with', 'words']

short_long = sorted(words, key=len)
print(short_long)

#output:   ['a', 'is', 'This', 'list', 'with', 'words']
```

## Sorting a str

    Sorting can be performed on a `str` which is no more than a sequence of characters
```
strng = 'hello world'
sorted_strng = sorted(strng)
print(sorted_strng)
#output:  [' ', 'd', 'e', 'h', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'o', 'r', 'w']
```
   - Notice that even the instance of a whitespace has an ordinal value and is sorted accordingly in the `str`

   - Also, it is important to note that a `list` data type was returned when utilizing the `sorted()` function

All of the same rules around character/ordinal value sorting still apply when sorting strings and in order to sort a string in actual alphabetical order, especially when capital letters are involved, you still need to enforce the use of the `key`
```
strng = 'Hello World'
sorted_strng = sorted(strng)
print(sorted_strng)
#output:  [' ', 'H', 'W', 'd', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'o', 'r']
```
**versus**:
```
strng = 'Hello World'
sorted_strng = sorted(strng,key=str.lower)
print(sorted_strng)
#output:  [' ', 'd', 'e', 'H', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'o', 'o', 'r', 'W']
```
## Making a unique key function by which to sort itemsÂ¶

Because Python allows users to define their own unique functions, users can apply those functions to the `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function to perform unique sorting needs.
```
ports_monitored = [('HTTPS', 443),('SSH', 22),('FTP-data', 20), ('HTTP', 80)]

sorted_ports = sorted(ports_monitored)
print(sorted_ports)   # by default it is going to sort the tuples inside the list based on the ordinal values of the characters found in index 0

#output: [('FTP-data', 20), ('HTTP', 80), ('HTTPS', 443), ('SSH', 22)]
```
In order to sort the `ports_monitored` by the actual port number found in each tuple we need to build a unique function that isolates the exact item we want to sort it by

```
ports_monitored = [('HTTPS', 443),('SSH', 22),('FTP-data', 20), ('HTTP', 80)]

def find_port(tup):  #this function is designed to take in 1 item at a time and isolate whatever is found in the [1] index position
    return tup[1]

sorted_by_ports = sorted(ports_monitored,key=find_port)
print(sorted_by_ports)

#output:  [('FTP-data', 20), ('SSH', 22), ('HTTP', 80), ('HTTPS', 443)]
```

## Sorting Dictionaries

   - The only way to sort a `dictionary` is to convert the keys or values to a `list` and call the sort method to sort the `list`.

   - A sorted list of the keys will be returned by default. You can specify the `items()` or `values()` if you wish to have them sorted as well.

Isolate the `key` in the `dictionary` found below and sort them
```
numbers = {'one':1, 'two':2, 'three':3}
sorted_keys = sorted(numbers.keys())
print(sorted_keys)    
#output:  ['one', 'three', 'two'] 
```
